hi im kArma ->🚀🎩🦝        
#!---> its a ddos tool made with a smart botnet who can communicate with each other, i make it talk so it always will make the most destroying attack on the system : D its changes after the system got the inspection  from proxychains who changes ip hole time 🦝🎩😄 it's not easier to trace then : D 🚀  
YO FRANCE i use u for the tests); -.- ------>> 4TheLulz & 4mybro Lucas 💚👽 <<-------° in js python & javascript 🚀🎩

exploit 130 CVEs from Jenkins and GitLab in an automated manner to create a botnet.
infiltrate systems by leveraging unauthorized access, deploying payloads, and installing malicious services.

cron job (*/1 * * * *) 

wrote with a malicious systemd service (kArmas.service) designed to persist even after system reboots and enable continual exploitation.

includes a "spreading mechanism" to scan IP ranges and attempt to exploit other systems in the network.

commands for self-destruction, clearing logs, and removing trace artifacts from an infected machine.

The attacker can open a reverse shell using Netcat (nc -lvnp $LPORT = 4488) to control the infected machine.
