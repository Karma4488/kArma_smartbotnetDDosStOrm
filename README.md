The script claims to exploit 130 CVEs from Jenkins and GitLab in an automated manner to create a botnet.
It attempts to infiltrate systems by leveraging unauthorized access, deploying payloads, and installing malicious services.

The script includes a payload that creates a cron job (*/1 * * * *) to repeatedly download and execute a file named kArmas_bot.sh from a C2 (Command and Control) server hosted on the attacker's machine🏁🏴‍☠️

It writes a malicious systemd service (kArmas.service) designed to persist even after system reboots and enable continual exploitation.🚀

The script includes a "spreading mechanism" to scan IP ranges and attempt to exploit other systems in the network.🦝

It includes commands for self-destruction, clearing logs, and removing trace artifacts from an infected machine.👾🤖

The attacker can open a reverse shell using Netcat (nc -lvnp $LPORT) to control the infected machine.🪾🥀
